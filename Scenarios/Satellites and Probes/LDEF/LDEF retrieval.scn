<h1>LDEF retrieval</h1>
<p>Originally, the retrieval of the LDEF (Long Duration Exposure Facility) from orbit
was planned for March 19, 1985. However, the schedule slipped, also because of the
Challenger disaster. It was finally returned from orbit by Shuttle mission STS-32 on
January 12, 1990, shortly before it would have burned up in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Your mission: Launch the Space Shuttle from Kennedy Space Center pad L39A to
retrieve the LDEF satellite from orbit.</p>
<p>Use the ascent autopilot MFD mode to program launch azimuth 90 (due east) and orbit
altitude 330 km. The LDEF passes over Cape Canaveral in its next orbit, so your launch
window is open.</p>
