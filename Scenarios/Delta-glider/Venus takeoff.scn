<h1>Delta-glider: Venus takeoff</h1>
<p>You have descended through the thick atmosphere of Venus, and set your glider down
on the surface.</p>
<p>Luckily, your ship is incredibly sturdy, and can withstand the atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>After admiring the view from the cockpit (an EVA would be unwise in this environment),
you decide to take off again and head back.</p>
<p>After igniting your engines, you discover a fatal flaw in your mission design:
The enormous ambient atmospheric pressure overpowers your engines and prevents them from
expelling any exhaust gases. You are stuck!</p>
<p>Your only option at this point is to disable the complex flight model and cheat the laws of physics.</p>
